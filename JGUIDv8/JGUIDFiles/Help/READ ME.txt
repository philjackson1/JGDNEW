About JGuiD
-------------------

Java Gui Designer was inspired by the project called "The GART" 
in Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gart/)
that is why interface in some places may look similar to "the gart" 
but JGuiD is entirely different from "THE GART". 
 
JGuiD implements a graphical designer for java with a 
special feature WYSIWYG(what you see is what you get).
you will be able to see the exact samething as you get when the
generated source is executed, at the time of  designing it self.

    that will take no time for getting used to.
3. Provides Keyboard shortcuts for all the action .
4. Dynamic reflection of properties changed on to the screen .

6. The generated output java source code will be neatly indented .

    list all the properties for the component (see a project file for reference).
